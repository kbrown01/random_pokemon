# Ramdom Pokemon Home Assistant Interface 

What started as a simple question in Home Assistant Forums led me to create this interface. 
Fun for the kids (and adults too) and was a great learning experience.
For more information and great background information, take a look here: [Daily Random Pokemon](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/daily-random-pokemon/529978/2)

## Final Result

I always like to give you a glance at what you are building first. 
This helps you to understand the components and what goes into the solution. 
What we are building is shown here:

![img/pokepanel.png](img/pokepanel.png)

There are several components in this interface.
Across the top, you can navigate to previous and next Pokemon based on the National ID.
You can "roll the dice" and grab a random pokemon whose ID ranges from 1 to 1008.
You can even select a specific Pokemon by name.

The data is all extracted from the [Restful Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/) into a few different sensors.

## Prerequisites

As for the GUI, there are of course some standard cards like horizontal-stack and vertical-stack. But there are also several custom cards used. These include:

- [Mushroom](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom)
- [Stack-in Card](https://github.com/custom-cards/stack-in-card)
- [State Switch](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-state-switch)
- [Gauge](https://github.com/custom-cards/gauge-card)
- [Auto Entities](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-auto-entities)
- [Config Template](https://github.com/iantrich/config-template-card)
- [Card Templater](https://github.com/gadgetchnnel/lovelace-card-templater)

If you want the solution to work as is, you will need to be sure you have these installed and working in your Lovelace configuration.

## Sensors

There are several sensors. One is used for the majority of the data for a specific Pokemon.
I chose to call this one sensor.random_pokemon and it is defined in my included sensor.yaml as:

```
##
## Random Pokemon
## 
- platform: rest
  name: Random Pokemon
  scan_interval: 360000
  resource_template: >
      {% if states('input_select.select_pokemon_mode') == 'Increment' %}
        https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{{ state_attr('sensor.random_pokemon','id') + 1 }}
      {% elif states('input_select.select_pokemon_mode') == 'Decrement' %}
        https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{{ state_attr('sensor.random_pokemon','id') - 1 }}
      {% elif states('input_select.select_pokemon_mode') == 'Name' %}
        https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{{ states('input_select.pokedex') }}
      {% else %}
        https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{{ range(1, 1008) | random }}
      {% endif %}
  value_template: "{{ now() }}"
  json_attributes:
    - abilities
    - base_experience
    - forms
    - game_indicies
    - height
    - held_items
    - id
    - is_default
    - location_area_encounters
    - moves
    - name
    - order
    - past_types
    - species
    - sprites
    - stats
    - types
    - weight
```

A second sensor is used for text descriptions as they are not maintained in the main REST call JSON that is returned.
Instead, the main JSON has links to the text in many languages. 
There is also additional information in this JSON that can be used.
I choose to call this sesnor.pokemon_species:

```
- platform: rest
  name: Pokemon Species
  scan_interval: 360000
  resource_template: "{{ state_attr('sensor.random_pokemon','species').url }}"
  value_template: "{{ now() }}"
  json_attributes:
    - base_happiness
    - capture_rate
    - color
    - egg_groups
    - evolution_chain
    - evolves_from_species
    - flavor_text_entries
    - form_descriptions
    - forms_switchable
    - gender_rate
    - genera
    - generation
    - growth_rate
    - habitat
    - has_gender_differences
    - hatch_counter
    - id
    - is_baby
    - is_legendary
    - is_mythical
    - name
    - shape
    - varieties
    - names
    - order
```

The third sensor is a template that contains the entire set of Pokemon names used to populate the input_select.
I choose to call this sensor.pokedex:

```
- platform: rest
  name: Pokedex
  scan_interval: 360000
  resource_template: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=1008
  value_template: "{{ now() }}"
  json_attributes:
    - results
```

You would note on the above sensors, the scan_interval is set really high. 
I do this because it is better to use an automation to trigger an update to the sensor so you can control the throttling.

Lastly, while it is not needed really but made this easier for the charting of the statistics, I created a template sensor the isolates only the stats.
That is called sesnor.pokemo_base_stats. The key here is that it's state is the maximum value of any one stat so as to calculate the relative value of them all.

```
###
### Pokemon Base Stats
###
  - name: Pokemon Base Stats
    state: '{{ state_attr("sensor.random_pokemon","stats") | map(attribute="base_stat") | max }}'
    attributes:
        hp: '{{ state_attr("sensor.random_pokemon","stats")[0].base_stat }}'
        attack: '{{ state_attr("sensor.random_pokemon","stats")[1].base_stat }}'
        defense: '{{ state_attr("sensor.random_pokemon","stats")[2].base_stat }}'
        special-attack: '{{ state_attr("sensor.random_pokemon","stats")[3].base_stat }}'
        special-defense: '{{ state_attr("sensor.random_pokemon","stats")[4].base_stat }}'
        speed: '{{ state_attr("sensor.random_pokemon","stats")[5].base_stat }}'
```
## Input Selects

There are two input selects created for this (one visible and one not). 
The first one is the one that contains all 1008 Pokemon names.
The second one merely sets the "mode" of the selection (Randon, Increment, Decrement, Name).
I believe this could be removed but I set it up this way to test and just left it.

You could just use a helper to create them, but as an example here is YAML in an include for input_select to set up the names.
It is obviously called input_select.pokedex.

```
#############################
######### pokedex ###########
#############################
pokedex:
    options:
        - bulbasaur
```

You would note that it is empty. This is because the options will be populated by an automation at home assistant startup.
We'll see this in the next section for automations.

The other input_select was created with a helper and only serves to know what the mode is for grabbing a Pokemon. The helper looks like this:

![img/select_pokemon_mode.png](img/select_pokemon_mode.png)

## Automations and Scripts

This first one is an Automation, it would basically re-populate the "options" in the input_select.pokedex with the data 
from the sensor.pokedex:

```
alias: Build Pokedex Options
description: ""
trigger:
  - platform: homeassistant
    event: start
condition: []
action:
  - service: input_select.set_options
    data_template:
      entity_id: input_select.pokedex
      options: |-
        {% set pdex = namespace(poke=[]) %}
          {% for pokemon in state_attr('sensor.pokedex','results')  %} 
            {% set pdex.poke = pdex.poke + [pokemon.name] %}
          {% endfor %}
        {{ pdex.poke | list }}
mode: single
```
The only one is a Script. This script would be called when one of the modes is chosen (Random, Increment, Decrement, Name).
The script takes in the mode and updates the main sensor.random_pokemon based on that mode.

```
alias: Get Pokemon
variables:
  pokemode: Increment
sequence:
  - service: input_select.select_option
    data:
      option: "{{ pokemode }}"
    target:
      entity_id: input_select.select_pokemon_mode
  - service: homeassistant.update_entity
    data: {}
    target:
      entity_id: sensor.random_pokemon
  - service: homeassistant.update_entity
    data: {}
    target:
      entity_id: sensor.pokemon_species
  - service: input_select.select_option
    data:
      option: Random
    target:
      entity_id: input_select.select_pokemon_mode
  - service: input_select.select_option
    data:
      option: "{{state_attr('sensor.random_pokemon','name') }}"
    target:
      entity_id: input_select.pokedex
mode: single
```

## The GUI

The remaining stuff is the GUI. We have sensors with lots of data we can use.

**NOTE: In this example code you will see that I have all the images stored locally on my Home Assistant server and I am not grabbing them from the web.
You can choose to do as you wish but in theory, one Pokemon could have 1 main image and 8 sprites with images that never change.
I chose to download and I am not posting them here, but I can provide to anyone requested them.**

A few notes on the GUI:


- I choose to use the hold action (and not the tap action) for the top Mushroom "buttons". 
This is probably not required as this entire screen is design for a computer. It is just my way.
- I choose not to do an immediate Select Pokemon by Name action when the input_select for Pokemon changes. This is because I did not want to get into any loop condition. So you change the Pokemon name in the input_select and then hold the icon to execute it.
- There are no really good options to display the charts in ider to compare. The best is the Apex radial bar charts but it looks like the information can only display "percentages" and not the actual values which make it worthless unless an alternate display of actual values is implemented which just wastes GUI space.
- I colored the carts by 0%, 30%, 60%, 80% or the highest value so you can see the relative effectiveness. You can of course change these.
